It breaks down casualties by vehicle type, road type, light and weather conditions, and urban vs. rural areas. A geospatial map highlights accident hotspots across the UK. This project demonstrates the effective use of Power BI for data modeling, DAX measures, and storytelling through data visualization to derive actionable insights from real-world datasets.
